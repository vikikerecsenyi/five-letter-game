# five-letter-game
This is a game where the computer randomly selects a 5-letter Hungarian word from a text file, and the goal is to guess this word! 
You can only guess with existing Hungarian words, but you can guess as many as you want. After your guess, I will tell you how many letters were in the correct position, but I won't reveal which ones!
